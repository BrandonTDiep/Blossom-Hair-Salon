## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The website used HTML to structure the page and its content. The page was designed with CSS and utilized media queries to adjust for different screen sizes. JavaScript was used for when the page becomes too small then a hamburger menu is displayed in the header.


## Lessons Learned:

Learned how to use flexbox which made layouting things easier. Practiced using media queries to adjust the page for different screen sizes. Learned some JavaScript that helped display the navigation menu in a different way for smaller screen sizes.
